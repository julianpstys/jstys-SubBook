This app is a solution to the problem described in Assignment 1. 
It allows the user to manage their subscriptions, and displays a 
list of all records to the user in an intuitive way. 

Classes:
The function and implementation of each class is given in documentation,
as well as in the UML class diagram located in doc/jstys-UML.png

XMLs: 
There are 3 main XML views that are used
1. The loading screen XML (activity_subscription_list.xml) displays 
a list of all existing records, and allows the user to click on each 
record to edit/delete them. It also provides a way to add a new 
subscription

2. The subscription adding XML (activity_main.xml) allows the user 
to add a new record, and go back to the main list view XML

3. The subscription editing XML (activity_record.xml) allows the user
to edit/delete an existing XML. This is loaded once the user clicks on
an entry from the loading screen ListView.

Acknowledgment:
The sources I used for specific lines of code are given through comments. I also
used the lonelyTwitter project that we learned about in the lab to help with some 
concepts (Gson, adapters).
